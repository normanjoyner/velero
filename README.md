# velero - Docs Branch

This special branch (`gh-pages`) is used to generate the [public documentation site](https://heptio.github.io/velero)
for velero. This site is hosted using [Github Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/).

The content files in this branch were generated with a tool that Heptio builds and maintains. This means that if you change docs content in this branch to fix something on the docs site, make sure to change the equivalent content in the docs directory on the master branch.
